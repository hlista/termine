# Termine

Text, resource collection, node based mmo with an emphasize on story telling and collaboration

Node System:

  * Nodes will have a unique identification hash along with a title describing the location
  * Players will be able to visit the node by typing "goto <hash #>"
  * Nodes will have an inspect text that describes what is currently happening at the node
  * Nodes will be handing out a resource that players can send their miners in to mine
  * Once a node runs out of a resource it progresses to the next plot point and inspect text changes
  * Nodes have neighbors that players can get a list of and visit
  * Once you know the hash of a node you can goto it from any node on the map
